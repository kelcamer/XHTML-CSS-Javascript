<h1>Euler, Leonhard</h1></head>

<h3>(1707-1783)</h3>

The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was 
born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of 
mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most 
prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <i>800 different books and 
papers</i>. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler's 
work on mathematical analysis, <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite> 
remained a standard textbook for well over a century. For the princess of 
Anhalt-Dessau he wrote Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772), 
giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the 
time.

<p>One can hardly write mathematical equations without copying Euler. Notations 
still in use today, such as <i>e</i> and <img src="pi.jpg">, were developed by Euler. He is 
perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's 
formula:

<p><center>cos<i>(x)</i> + <i>i</i>sin(x) = <i>e</i> <sup>(ix)</sup></center></p>

demonstrates the relationship between analysis, trignometry and imaginary 
numbers, in one beautiful and elegant equation.</p>

<p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
