<h2>History:</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a time, back in 1999, a woman named Kelsey Cameron founded the Fisher Price Toy store.  She named the store after her favorite pet fish whose name was Fisher, and she had purchased him for a great price.  One day, she stumbled upon the magic that all children love... Pokemon!(EVEN the fish kind!!!!!)<br /><br /><br /><br />
She stocked up on their sets,<br />
With more courage than the rest,<br />
And all the little kids poured,<br />
Right into her store.<br /><br />

And so there she stood,<br />
The children knew that they could,<br />
Get all of their dreams come true.<br /><br />

All they had to do,<br />
Was get a penny or two,<br />
And a parent to help them have fun,<br /><br />

The fun times they had, <br />
They never were bad,<br />
When all of the day had been done.<br /><br />
