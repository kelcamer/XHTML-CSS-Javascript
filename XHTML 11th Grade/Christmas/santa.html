       <p>*The following information comes from Wikipedia.com<br>
         <br>
         <span style="text-indent: !important; text-transform: capitalize; text-shadow: #000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; text-decoration: blink;">By the end of the 20th century, the reality of mass mechanized production became more fully accepted by the Western public.</span><br><br>
         That shift was reflected in the modern depiction of Santa's residence—now often humorously portrayed as a fully mechanized production and distribution facility, equipped with the latest manufacturing technology, and overseen by the elves with Santa and Mrs. Claus as executives and/or managers.
         
         
         
  <br><br> 
         An excerpt from a 2004 article, from a supply chain managers' trade magazine, aptly illustrates this depiction:
         Santa's main distribution center is a sight to behold. <br>
       At 4,000,000 square feet (370,000 m2), it's one of the world's largest facilities.</p>
       <p><br>
       A real-time warehouse management system (WMS) is of course required to run such a complex. </p>
       <p>The facility makes extensive use of task interleaving, literally combining dozens of DC activities (putaway, replenishing, order picking, sleigh loading, cycle counting) in a dynamic queue...the DC elves have been on engineered standards and incentives for three years, leading to a <span class="blue">12% gain in productivity...</span><br>
       The WMS and transportation system are fully integrated, allowing (the elves) to make optimal decisions that balance transportation and order picking and other DC costs. Unbeknownst to many, Santa actually has to use many sleighs and fake Santa drivers to get the job done Christmas Eve, and the transportation management system (TMS) optimally builds thousands of consolidated sacks that maximize cube utilization and minimize total air miles</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p> Many television commercials, comic strips and other media depict this as a sort of humorous business, with Santa's elves acting as a sometimes mischievously disgruntled workforce, cracking jokes and pulling pranks on their boss. For instance, a Bloom County story from December 15, 1981 through December 24, 1981 has Santa rejecting the demands of PETCO (Professional Elves Toy-Making and Craft Organization) for higher wages, a hot tub in the locker room, and “short broads,” with the elves then going on strike. President Reagan steps in, fires all of Santa’s helpers, and replaces them with out-of-work air traffic controllers (an obvious reference to the 1981 air traffic controllers' strike), resulting in a riot before Santa vindictively rehires them in humiliating new positions such as his reindeer.[44] In The Sopranos episode, "...To Save Us All from Satan's Power", Paulie Gualtieri says he "Used to think Santa and Mrs. Claus were running a sweatshop over there. ... The original elves were ugly, <em>traveled with Santa to throw bad kids a beatin</em>', and gave the good ones toys."
       In Kyrgyzstan, a mountain peak was named after Santa Claus, after a Swedish company had suggested the location be a more efficient starting place for present-delivering journeys all over the world, than Lapland.       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p> In the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, a Santa Claus Festival was held on December 30, 2007, with government officials attending. 2008 was officially declared the Year of <em>Santa Claus in the country</em>. The events are seen as moves to boost tourism in Kyrgyzstan.
         
         
       Santa Claus toy is a popular entertainment for children.</p>

       <p> 2009 Liverpool Santa Dash
      The Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of Santa Clauses is held by Derry City, Northern Ireland. On September 9, 2007. A total of 12,965 people dressed up as Santa or Santa's helper brought down the previous record of 3,921, which was set during the Santa Dash event in Liverpool City Centre in 2005. A gathering of Santas in 2009 in Bucharest, Romania attempted top the world record, but failed with only 3939 Santas.</p>

       That's right kids.  Santa's elves are technicians, not innovators.  That's a pretty big let-down huh?</p>
