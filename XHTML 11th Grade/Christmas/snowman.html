<h1 style="font-weight: bold; color: #FFF;"><span class="turn">F</span>rosty The Snow Man</h1>

Frosty the Snow Man came to town one bright, cold winter's day. The first real snow of the winter had fallen the night before.
<br />
In the morning, out came the children, and they started to roll snowballs. Round and round the snowy yard they rolled the snowballs. Soon they had two fine big ones.
<br />
Round and round the yard again-there was a little snowball just the right size for a snow man's head.
<br />
Billy ran home and brought two bits of coal to use for the snow man's eyes.
<br />
Sally have him a button nose and a funny corncob pipe. Tommy brought floppy galoshes and a scarf for the snow man.
<br />
And Joe brought him a pair of old red mittens to wear.
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />




"Now we need a hat ," said Sally and Joe.<br />
So they all began to look around.<br /><br />

Sally found an old cap. But it didn't look just right.<br />
Billy found a battered felt hat. But it still didn't seem right.<br /><br />

Just then, down the street came the whistling wind.<br />
And it blew to their feet a shiny top hat.<br /><br />

"Just what we need!" cried Sally and Joe.<br />
"It's like magic!" said Billy and Tommy.<br /><br /><br /><br />

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />



It was Tommy who picked up the shiny top hat and put it on the snow man's head. Zing! Tommy's hand sprang back with a shock.<br /><br />

"It's magic" gasped Tommy.<br /><br />

"So it is," said a voice, a deep, chuckly voice they had never heard before. "And a pleasant sort of magic,<br />
if I do say so myself."<br /><br />

"It's the snow man!" whispered Sally. And so it was.<br />
<br />
"Frosty the Snow Man, at your service," said he.<br />
That's how Frosty the Snow Man came alive.<br />



<br /><br /><br />

If you have never had a snow man for a friend, you can
scarcely imagine all the fun those children had.<br /><br />

For Frosty took them coasting-and never had their sleds slid so swiftly and far.<br /><br />

Frosty helped them build a snow house- and never had blocks packed so firmly and well.<br /><br /><br /><br />





They all went ice skating- and the magical part was that while they were with Frosty, then children could stay out and play in the snow and never get shivery cold.<br /><br />

Was it Frosty's warm heart, or his magical smile?<br />
Whatever it was, they thought it was fine.<br /><br />

Each morning when the children came out to play,<br />
Frosty had a wonderful plan all set.<br /><br /><br /><br />





One morning he said, "Let's go shopping today.<br />
I've never seen a store, you know."<br /><br />

So they all joined hands and away they skipped,<br />
off towards town where the shops stood in rows.<br /><br />

It was fun showing Frosty around! For he<br />
thought every window was wonderful.<br /><br />

All around the town they led Frosty that<br />
day, while the warm wintry sun shone down.<br /><br />

Soon they came to a corner and around the<br />
corner came a warm, gusty wind. Off went<br />
Frosty's hat. And away went Frosty after it.<br /><br />


Then Tweet! sang the traffic cop's loud whistle.<br />
And the children could not follow Frosty, because<br />
traffic streamed by--buses and trucks and family cars.<br /><br />

Tweet! went the traffic cop's whistle again.<br />
The crossing stood empty before them now,<br />
but there was not a sign of Frosty to be seen.<br /><br /><br /><br />





Only down the street his top hat rolled,<br />
all by itself in the melting snow.<br /><br />

"Mr. Policeman!" the children cried. "Where has
Frosty the Snow Man gone?"<br />
"Oh," said the policeman.<br /><br />

"Frosty the Snow Man has gone away<br />
Where all snow men go on a sunny day.<br />
But he'll be back at your bidding and call<br />
Whenever great heaps of snowflakes fall."<br /><br />

And he will.<br />
THE END





<h1 style="font-size: 18px;">Frosty The Snowman</h1><br /><br />

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul<br />
With a corncob pipe and a button nose<br />
and two eyes made out of coal.<br /><br />

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say<br />
He was made of snow but the children<br />
know how he came to life one day.<br /><br />

There must have been some magic in that<br />
old silk hat they found<br />
For when they placed it on his head<br />
he began to dance around.<br /><br />

O Frosty the snowman<br />
was alive as he could be<br />
And the children say he could laugh<br />
and play just the same as you and me.<br /><br />

Thumpetty thump thump<br />
thumpety thump thump<br />
Look at Frosty go<br />
Thumpetty thump thump<br />
thumpety thump thump<br />
Over the hills of snow<br /><br />

Frosty the snowman knew<br />
the sun was hot that day<br />
So he said "Let's run and<br />
we'll have some fun<br />
now before I melt away."<br /><br />

Down to the village<br />
with a broomstick in his hand<br />
Running here and there all<br />
around the square saying<br />
Catch me if you can.<br /><br />

He led them down the streets of town<br />
right to the traffic cop<br />
And he only paused a moment when<br />
he heard him holler "Stop!"<br /><br />

For Frosty the snow man<br />
had to hurry on his way.<br /><br />

But he waved goodbye saying<br />
"Don't you cry<br />
I'll be back again some day.<br /><br />

"Thumpetty thump thump<br />
thumpety thump thump<br />
Look at Frosty go<br />
Thumpetty thump thump<br />
thumpety thump thump<br />
Over the hills of snow<br />
