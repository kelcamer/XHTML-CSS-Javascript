        <td width="324" rowspan="7" class="format"><b><p>Dear Kelsey,<br />
          
          How did the Grinch steal Christmas?<br />
          
          Sincerely,
  <br />
          Cindy-Lou Who

        <p><br />
            Dear Cindy-Lou Who,
            <br />
            My dear you see, you have it all wrong.
            <br />
            Forgive me my who if I'm coming on strong,
            <br />
            But the Grinch didn't steal Christmas; oh no he did not!
            <br />
            What the Grinch did well, was not a whole awful lot.
            <br />
            <br />
            
            The Grinch did his best, in spite of the season,
            <br />
            To ruin Christmas, with no rhyme and no reason.
            <br />
            The Grinch you see tried, and he tried, and he Tried TRIED TRIED TRIED,
            <br />
            To take the happiness of your little town,
            <br />
            He did it all with a suit, hat and frown.
            <br /><br />
            
            
            But despite his best efforts, his plans, and his schemes
            <br />
            To take away Christmas happiness and dreams
            <br />
            All the Grinch took were things.
            <br />
            He took toys and food, and presents and rings,
            <br />
            He took everything he could carry, and some he could not
            <br /><br />
            
            
            He took Pop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums!
            <br />
            Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums!
            <br />
            He slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos' feast!
            <br />
            He took the Who-pudding! He took the roast beast!
            <br />
            The Grinch he was mean no one knew quite the reason.
            <br /><br />
            
            
            But he drove up the mountain in his sled pulled by Max
            <br />
            A reindeer, or dog, who just wanted to relax.
            <br />
            When he got to the top he listened you see
            <br />
            And he heard the singing of all Whos who agree,
            <br />
            Christmas just can't be stolen in the night
            <br />
            
            <br />
            
            
            It came without ribbons! It came without tags!
            <br />
            It came without packages, boxes, or bags!
            <br />
            Christmas, you see, doesn't come from a store,
            <br />
            Christmas does indeed mean quite a bit more.
            <br />
            So the Grinch, my dear Who, did nothing at all.
            <br />
            Happy Holidays,
            <br />
        </p>

    	<td colspan="4">The Grinch is a fictional character created by Dr. Seuss. He first appeared as the main protagonist in the 1957 children's book, How the Grinch Stole Christmas!
<br /><br />
The devious, anti-holiday spirit of the character has led to the term Grinch coming to refer to a person opposed to Christmas time celebrations[1][2][3] or to someone with a coarse, greedy attitude.[4] In fact, a document in the live-action film (the Book of Who) stated that "The term Grinchy shall apply when Christmas spirit is in short supply".
<br /><br />
The Grinch has since become an icon of the winter holidays, despite the character's hatred of the season, and has appeared on various forms of memorabilia such as Christmas ornaments, plush dolls, Halloween costumes, and various clothing items.
<br /><br />
In 2002, TV Guide ranked The Grinch number 5 on its "50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time" list.[5]

        Although the animated film and all subsequent visual media depict the Grinch as green with creme colored eyes, in the original Seuss book he, like everything else, is printed in black, white, and shades of red, his appearance is mainly described to look like a giant, green, mutated chimpanzee. He lives in an isolated cave near Whoville, the town in which the original story takes place. His only companion is his faithful dog, Max (a mix breed). He despises the Christmas holiday because his heart is "two sizes too small," and hatches a plan to steal the Whos' Christmas gifts and decorations, an act for which he disguises himself in a Santa suit.

As a child, the Grinch was shown lifting a Christmas tree over his head and throwing it across the room. He also most likely carved out most of his cave with his bare hands, as the entrance was a rock wall when he was a child. The film also presents a number of other powers.</td>

    	<td colspan="2">In the live-action film, the Grinch's hatred of Christmas derived from a traumatic childhood memory. As an 8-year-old, most of his classmates made fun of him because of his beard when he tried to shave it to look his best during Christmas Day. The mocking laughter of the classmates made the Grinch so angry that he took out his rage against the classroom, frightening the classmates and declaring his hatred for Christmas before running away to live in the top of the mountain.
