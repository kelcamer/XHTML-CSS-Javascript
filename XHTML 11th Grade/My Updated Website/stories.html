  <h2>Florian's Stories</h2>
  <p>My boyfriend's name is Florian Gawlitta. He loves to write, and  he wants to write as many books as he can. Writing is his passion, and he wants to know what you guys think about his stories. :) </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A tree is nothing without the leaves. And the leaves are nothing without the tree. That's how it has always been, and that's how nature created it.&quot; He didn't mind that he talked to himself as he looked out of the slightly open window. The cherry trees outside were blooming and the wind was gently blowing his hair behind his face - another force of nature, he thought, that can be so nice when weak, but devastating when strong. He rested his elbows on the windowsill and watched the wind blowing off several cherry blossom leaves. </p>
  <p><br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If everything could be so simple as nature&quot;, he said, looking away with disgust, not of nature, but of humans who relentlessly kill each other over things like money or honour. &quot;I wish I'd be a leaf&quot;, he said to himself, looking at the spectacle in front of his eyes. The wind blew the leaves on a nearby house, and when they hit the ground, they rested, knowing their journey has come to an end. &quot;That's how leaves are&quot;, he silently muttered. &quot;Their whole life they were attached to one tree, they grew up with it. They lived with and depended on each other. The leaf can't live without the tree, or else it dies. And a tree without leaves...&quot;</p>
  <p><br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped, grabbing a cigarette from a nearby table and lit it. As he blew the smoke outside the window, it joined together with the wind, carrying it away to the sky. He smiled. &quot;A tree without leaves is useless. The leaves are doing all the work. They are producing the air we need to breathe. The tree is merely the holder.&quot; The cigarette was growing shorter in his shaking hands, and he clumsily scratched the back of his neck. &quot;Like a human&quot;, he said in a mocking tone, moving around his arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br />
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;Without the body, my arms would be useless. My arms are like leaves. But without the arms, my body would turn useless too.&quot; He stopped for a moment, and smiled. &quot;Well, at least it would hinder me a lot. Like a tree.&quot; He was finishing the cigarette and looked out of the window again. The wind was getting stronger, and his eyes glanced thoughtfully over the cherry trees. &quot;A lot of air will fade tonight&quot;, he said, observing the intensity of the upcoming storm. &quot;And a lot of leaves are going to lose their life. A brutality.&quot; He sighed. He was getting melancholy more often lately, but he always felt it was for a good reason. On days like this, were the storm was brewing and everyone was trying to stay inside, he thought of all the poor animals and plants. He laughed at the irony.</p>
  <p><br /><br /><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humans always say they are the most adaptable species on the planet. And still, as they evolved, he felt they were getting weaker. When it rained, they searched shelter instead of enduring it. Any hardships that they had to face they tried to avoid rather than to overcome. The thing is that he couldn't tell if this was a sign of intelligence or degeneration. He coughed, the smoke hanging in his throat.</p>
  <p><br />
    <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the cigarette stump though he realized that the humans were slowly destroying themselves anyway. He was no exception. &quot;Maybe humans who formed habits can't break out of them anymore&quot;, he whispered, as if afraid someone could hear him. &quot;Maybe...the leaves sometimes want to leave the tree. If it becomes corrupt, if it becomes soulless, and if it becomes caught in it's own habit...&quot; He gasped. &quot;Or diseased.&quot; He looked down at the cigarette again, then his arms and legs. &quot;I can make my own decisions. These leaves can't. As sad as this is,  I am a human.&quot; He smiled, looking out in the darkness. The moon was now shining and illuminating the place in an almost eerie fashion. &quot;Seems I need to make the most out of what I am&quot;, he said, awaiting the new day. Because humans shouldn't be thrown around in the wind like leaves.&quot;</p>

  <hr size="10px" color="black" />
  <p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The storms were raging,  waves crashed upon the boat, the rain was falling hard and heavy, trying to enter their minds with its beating sound, but they didn't move or collapse. They knew their goal, focused on their only need, they kept moving forward, no matter what difficulties did rise upon them. They did need neither fortune nor luck, rather they kept working towards their goals they wanted to reach. They controlled their power inside their heads, their thoughts being channeled into a hexagon, each corner of it being one part of the passion they poured into their collective mission. </p>
  <p><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked up on their small boat, it being nothing more than their tool that should have taken them where they wanted to be. Now out on wide sea, their eyes turned to slits, their hexagons tightened, holding onto the last sliver of hope they had left, as the beast of the sea threw wave upon wave towards them. The boat was shaking, the grip of the ocean wrapped tightly around it, like a men holds his love, just that this grip was more violently than anything they've ever felt. They knew they needed to remain calm, to focus, to pour all their hope, love, passion and dedication into getting this boat to the island they wanted to get to. </p>
  <p><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then suddenly, the sun rose slowly, covering part of the sky in an orange that looked so innocent, pure and lovely as a newborn, giving the perfect contrast to the raging tide underneath their feet. <br /><br /><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their goals were all different yet the same - one wanted to be united with the love of his life, living on the very island he wanted to reach no matter the cost - another wanted to begin a new life on a place that is rich with possibilities. Yet another wanted to make as much money as he could on this island - but they all agreed that the most noble goal belonged to the person who wanted to be with the person he loved. <br /><br />
  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always sat in the corner of the boat, never talking much - and even now, that the boat was shaking and the sea was ravaging, he seemed calm, as if the essence and core of his mind would have been channeled into only the thought of the person he wanted to be with more than anything. His green eyes clashed with the dark blue sea, yet he kept talking of how much the colour of the sea reminded him of her eyes. He seemed happy even now that their lives seemed in grave danger. Still, he was giving directions to everyone on the ship despite not being the captain, taking everything as easily as a morning walk in the park - it inspired everyone around him, and they secured the ship. </p>
  <p><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the captain seemed more secure as he steered it around the waves, his grip tight around the sterring wheel. It felt like a ride in a demonic rollercoaster, like destiny playing the cards, like Fortuna rolling the dice - and everyone was hoping that she wouldn't roll a 6. But everyone knew it would be alright the moment the sea was calming down and the sun was rising up the sky farther and farther, changing the orange more and more into a bright blue. The hexagons that have tightened in their mind released with a creeking sound, and the silver lining became clear.</p>
  <p><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy with the green eyes ran to the front of the boat, and started crying. The other members of the crew followed hastily and saw what made him cry - the island was visible, a glorious sight. The boats horn was telling it of their arrival. </p>
  <p><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dozens of people ran towards the shore and greeted them with waves, wondering about the strangers, curiosity in their faces. And amongst these people was a girl, with long hair, blue eyes, even bluer than the ocean.</p>
  <p><br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran into the ocean, swimming in the direction of the ship. The boy knew it was the girl he wanted to see, the girl he conquered the sea and braced the storm for. He jumped into the water and swam towards her, and everyone was looking at them, astounded by their love for each other. It emanated from their hearts, colouring the sea red and the sky purple. They hugged, kissed, cried, and even as the boat finally hit the shore, they were still swimming around, happy they finally had each other. They soon left the island to start their life together, and no one ever saw them again after that day - but they all knew they found happiness somewhere, being together. </p>
  <p><br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship has reached its goal, the members were happy. Everyone found what they sought.</p>

  <h2><span class="story">Kelsey's Stories </span></h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm Kelsey (as you probably already know) and I like to write quotes and stories and poems every once in a while, for fun. I'm generally a better poet, but Florian is a much better writer. But both of us love to read and write, and we understand hidden symbolism.  So please, read my poems and his stories, and tell us what you think. :D</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;Always fight for the ones you love,<br />
    though you may fight alone,<br />
    though you may fight in chains,<br />
    better to fight and fail than to never have fought at all.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;Sparkling shining stars,<br />
    I know
    where you are.<br />
    Around me and within me,<br />
  Simultaneously.&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;Live your life in such a way, that when you die you won't be afraid,<br />
    to say you have done your best,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to live your life better<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the rest.&quot;  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;If you live your life blindly accepting that 2+2 = 5 without ever asking for proof, your memory uses the same thought process to justify any irrational concept, and your memory literally becomes invalid.&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;Always ask why, <br />
    and you shall fly high,<br />
    ignore society's sighs,<br />
  and always said &quot;I&quot;.&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;Simple clouds,<br />
    speaking loud,<br />
    rain drops,<br />
    writing with chalk,<br />
    green grass,<br />
    adorable past,<br />
    feeling full,<br />
    the sounds of your soul.<br />
    One more,<br />
    to adore,<br />
    they understand,<br />
    and take your hand,<br />
    so many things they could do,<br />
  and the only thing they want is<br />
  you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;I miss the living more than I miss the dead, because this dead was ready to die, and the living are still ready to live.&quot;  
  <p><font style="font-size: 10px;"><strong>&quot;Small writing<br />
    can connote<br />
    small implications.&quot;
  </strong></font>  
  <p>&quot;When he left, my grandfather finished writing his life story.<br />
  It was published in the minds and hearts of who ever knew him.&quot;  
  <p>
  <p>&quot;Think, Feel,<br />
    Think, Feel,<br />
    Think, Feel,<br />
    A battle between worlds can create unity,<br />
    In the same way thinking and feeling connect as one.&quot;
  <p>    
  <p>&quot;Don't dwell in the past, live for the present, create your future.&quot;  
  <p>  
  <p>&quot;Gears turn,<br />
    Gears sway,<br />
    these gears of thought,<br />
    never go away,<br />
    but only if you use those gears,<br />
    because in time,<br />
  wet metal rusts.&quot;  
  <p>True Friends
    </p>
  </p>
  <p>&quot;A true friend will respect your values, let you achieve your goals, appreciate your admiration.<br />
    A true friend will stay with you always. <br />
    A true friend won't care how you look, they'll look at your soul.<br />
    A true friend will listen to you and help with your problems, as well as embracing your other emotions.<br />
    <br />
  Be a true friend, and true friends will come.&quot;</p>

  <p>Quotes:</p>
  <p>&quot;Life is like a mushroom, great taste, horrible texture.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;In the same way the color of one skin does not solely define a person, neither does religion, gender, or nationality.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;A racist man is racist against himself.&quot;<br />
    <br />
  &quot;Ignorance comes in three forms; the nice, the mean, and the evil. Nice ignorance is simply not understanding a situation. Mean ignorance is not understanding a situation and having no desire to understand it. Evil Ignorance is not understanding a situation, having no desire to understand it, and using it as an excuse to facilitate deep insurities through the expense of another person.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Love who you are, because who else can you be?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Inspiration is nothing without action.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Would you rather live in poverty or be a dead billionaire?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The optimist sees the best future, the pessimist sees the worst future, but the engineer controls the future any which way she wants.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Two individuals with the same exact values can have interpretations as opposite as black and white.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Love is not limited to family. Love can happen in the presence of family or in the absense of family. It bonds together two sympathetic creatures, whether they are blood-related or not.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;When you accept a false premise, you willfully give up your ability and neccessity to reason.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Exercise is to the body as thinking is to the mind.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You cannot find your motivation in money or people. You can only find it in your passions, your love, and your values.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;If you always beg for more, you will never be satisfied.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;How can you ever find the correct answers if you refuse to ask the correct questions?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I respect all religions as long as they do not harm me.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;A bird can only fly once it has earned it's wings.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;How can you judge someone if you've never judged yourself?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The root cause of insecurity in most cases, is the way the child was raised.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Gum can actually relieve stress. The constant chewing relaxes your jaw, and all your stress is chewed away.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Sometimes your best isn't enough, but that doesn't mean you should give up.  It will pay off eventually.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;When you spend time with people who drink alcohol, it creates both a desolate solidarity but also a form of independence for you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Immortality is possible in the sense that a person's thoughts, beliefs, and actions can be captured in a human memory.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The weather could always freeze, but my heart burns warmer than a thousand suns.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The most rewarding jobs come with no instructions or experience.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Always follow your own advice.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Don't give me advice if you don't want me to follow it.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Sometimes the best cure is the disease.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Love is simply an extension of understanding.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;An idea may be great, but without action, it is nothing.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Music is a way to express raw emotion and raw brainpower.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;When life hands you lemons, make limeade.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Never be ashamed of something you can't control.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The prospect of Science ignites the mind.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Your selfishness is your identity; your love of your being; your continuous worship to yourself.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Your soulmate represents a reflection of yourself and your values.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Silence is much worse than rejection.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I don't respect God, but I respect his follower's opinions.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The moment when you have an object of desire is the moment it seems to be impossible from your reach.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;A blind person cannot see what you mean.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Just because a zebra is black and white, that does not make him morally gray.&quot;<br />
  </p>
  <p>&quot;You cannot see if you never choose to look.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Law does not dictate morality.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Nervousness is simply a fear of failure.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I judge others solely on their morals and actions.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;If you ever feel older than your physical self, use it as a growing opportunity to expand your knowledge.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Love must be earned.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Our imperfections make us perfect humans.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;If growing old makes you indifferent, I want to stay young forever.&quot;</p>
