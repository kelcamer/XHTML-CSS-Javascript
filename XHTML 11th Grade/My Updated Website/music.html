  <p>I compose songs weekly.  Piano is my passion, and I enjoy creating songs with hidden meanings - leaving the user to guess as to what they represent. I would love to hear any feedback after you listen to my songs below. I wrote all of these songs, unless otherwise noted.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Rise of Rationality
  <br />
  <embed src="assets/Rise of Rationality.mp4" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
  <br>
  I wrote this song, because I'm tired of people thinking they deserve what someone else earns. Many people don't realize that this &quot;entitlement&quot; ideal is the equivalent of stealing.</p>
 
  <p>DreamScape<br>
  <embed src="assets/DreamScape.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
  <br>
  Simply put, I created this piece to relax me for when I sleep.</p>
  <p>The Kiss of a Flower<br>
  <embed src="assets/The Kiss of a Flower.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
  <br>
  I won 2nd place in my school PTSA contest with this song. <br>
  This song was inspired by my lovely boyfriend, Florian Gawlitta.  &lt;3
  </p>
  <p>Our Song<br>
  <embed src="assets/Our Song.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
  <br>
  Imagine someone who is exactly like you, someone who would do anything for you, someone who loves you as much as life itself.   That person, is Florian Gawlitta, as I mentioned above. &lt;3</p>
  <p>Trainman the Montage<br>
  <embed src="assets/Trainman the Montage.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
  <br>
  A wicked combination of Crazy Train, Iron Man, and my own personal improvisational twists.
  <br>
  AI AI AI! xD
  <br>
  *Note: This is not a fully original song.</p>
  <p>The Momma Song<br>
    <embed src="assets/The Momma Song.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
    <br />
   My mom loves this song a little too much. xD I'm going to write it down and frame it and give it to her for Christmas.</p>
  <p>The Wrong Judgement<br>
   <embed src="assets/The Wrong Judgement.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
   <br>
  I wrote this song because so many people in today's society judge on all the wrong things; like race, religion, gender, ethnicity, and appearance.   Don't judge on superficial things.  Judge on morals.</p>
  <p>Tickling Snow<br>
   <embed src="assets/Tickling Snow.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
   <br>
  It's that time of year again! That's right, Christmas time!  I wrote this piece to celebrate the winter holidays. You can feel the snow on the tips of your nose, and your frozen numb hands making snowmen. :D</p>
  <p>Jingle Grandmas<br>
  <embed src="assets/Jingle Grandmas.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
  <br>
  As strange as the name sounds, this is simply a combo of the Classic Jingle Bells and Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  If you're a grandma, WATCH OUT!<br>
  *Note: This is not a fully original song.  </p>
  <p>Joy to the World<br>
  <embed src="assets/Joy to the World.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
  <br>
  The classic Christmas song, and I didn't create it, I simply played it with a passion.<br>
  *Note: This is not a fully original song.  </p>
  <p>Trip around the Sun<br>
    <embed src="assets/Trip Around the Sun.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">

  <p>Space and Teleportation<br>
   <embed src="assets/Space and Teleportation.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">

  <p>We the Colonies<br>
   <embed src="assets/We the Colonies.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
   <br>
  This is a song I wrote for my US History Class about the American Revolution.</p>
  <p>The National Divide<br>
   <embed src="assets/The National Divide.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">

   <embed src="assets/The Great Race.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
   <br>

   <embed src="assets/Mary had a Little Explosion.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
   <br>
  Mary had a little lamb?  Well, that lamb exploded...  My insane version of that childhood song Mary had a Little Lamb with a twist.</p>
  <p>Love Yourself<br>
   <embed src="assets/Love Yourself.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
   
   <br>
  Too many people don't love themselves, and this song is designed to teach you how to be proud of your values, your life, and your achievements.</p>
  <p>Enjoying Life<br>
   <embed src="assets/Enjoying Life.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
   <br>
  We only have so long to live. Let's make the best out of this life by enjoying it to every possible extent. :D</p>
  <p>Experience Everything<br>
  <embed src="assets/Experience Everything.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
  <br>
  Don't miss out on what life offers!  &quot;Smile like no one is looking, 
  Sing like no one's listening, and Dance like no one is watching.&quot; - Anonymous</p>
  <p>The Car Engine<br>
  <embed src="assets/The Car Engine.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
  <br>
  This is exactly how I imagine a car engine would sound.</p>
  <p>T-monster<br>
  <embed src="assets/T-monster.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
  <br>
  I have only gotten a detention once in my life.   I was 5 seconds late when I entered the classroom, and my teacher (one of my favorites) gave me a referral without ever telling me.  I was so angry once I heard about it, it inspired this song, T-monster, since her name started with a T.  In retrospect, this song was definitely worth the detention.  XD</p>
  <p>Jumping<br>
  <embed src="assets/Jumping.m4a" height=60 width=144 type="audio/mpeg" autostart="false">
  <br>
  I didn't create this song, but it's really fun to play quickly.
