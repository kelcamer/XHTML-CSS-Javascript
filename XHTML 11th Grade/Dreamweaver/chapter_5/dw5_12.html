<p class="body_text">This month we will be baking oven chicken fingers that are  dipped in a milk and egg mixture, then coated with breadcrumbs. The chocolate  chip cookies are based on a famous recipe that includes chocolate chips,  M&amp;Ms, oatmeal, and pecans. Yummy! We will be learning some of the basics  like how to cream butter and crack eggs without dropping shells into the batter.</p>
<p class="body_text">We will provide French fries, green beans, fruit salad, and a beverage  to accompany the chicken fingers.</p>
