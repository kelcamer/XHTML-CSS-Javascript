<p class="body_text">This looks easier than it is! Chef Carolyne is demonstrating  the first steps in making Chinese dumplings, known as <em>jiaozi</em> (pronounced geeow dz). Notice that she is using a  traditional wooden rolling pin to roll out the dough. These dumplings were  stuffed with pork and then steamed, although other popular fillings are made  with chicken and leeks or vegetables with spiced tofu and cellophane noodles.  Dumplings can be steamed, boiled, or fried, and have unique names depending on  the preparation method.</p>
