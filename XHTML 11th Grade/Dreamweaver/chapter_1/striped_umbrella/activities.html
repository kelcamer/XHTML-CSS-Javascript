<p class="body_text">Some of our visitors enjoy local fishing trips. We have a  small fleet of boats that will take you out for either a half or a full day. Or  you can surf cast, right from the beach. But beware of Ralph, our resident blue  heron. He knows what you fishermen have in your coolers and if you aren't  careful, he'll take your catch off your hands and make a quick getaway!</p>
<p class="body_text"><img src="file:///U|/Dreamweaver/chapter_5/assets/two_dolphins_small.jpg" alt="Two dolphins surfing the wake" width="350" height="219" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="right" />And don&rsquo;t forget our dolphin cruises. We have a unique  approach &mdash; two boats speed along, side by side, about 50 yards apart. The  dolphins love it because it generates a huge wake. You'll see them jumping  right between the boats! You can arrange for tickets for fishing excursions or  dolphin cruises at The Club House desk.</p>
