Poets have waxed  poetically over them throughout the years. Many persons consider the beauty and  fragrance of roses to be unmatched in nature. The varieties are endless,  ranging from floribunda to hybrid teas to shrub roses to climbing roses. Each  variety has its own personality and preference in the garden setting. Pictured  on the left is a Summer Breeze Hybrid Tea bud. This variety is fast growing and  produces spectacular blooms that are beautiful as cut flowers in arrangements.  The enchanting fragrance will fill your home with summer sweetness. They  require full sun. Hybrid teas need regular spraying and pruning, but will reward  you with classic blooms that will be a focal point in your landscaping and provide  you with beautiful arrangements in your home. They are well worth the effort!</span></p>
<p class="paragraph_text">  For ease of growing, <img src="assets/rose_bloom.jpg" alt="Rose Bloom" name="rose_bloom" width="300" height="207" hspace="20" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" id="rose_bloom" />Knock Out&reg; roses are some of our  all-time favorites. Even beginners will not fail with these garden delights.  They are shrub roses and prefer full sun, but can take partial shade. They are  disease resistant and drought tolerant. You do not have to be concerned with  either black spot or dead-heading with roses such as the Knock out&reg;, making  them an extremely low-maintenance plant. They are also repeat bloomers,  blooming into late fall. The shrub can grow quite large, but can be pruned to  any size. The one you see on the right is Southern Belle. Check out all our  varieties as you will not fail to have great color with these plants.</p>
