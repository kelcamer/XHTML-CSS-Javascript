<p>January Special: Paella Pans</p>
<p>We try to feature special items each month and love to  promote local foods. This month features paella pans in three sizes: 12 inches,  18 inches, and 24 inches.</p>
<p>This pan is made of polished stainless steel with red baked  enamel handles for easy transfer from stove top to table. Paella is a  traditional Spanish dish with rice as the basic ingredient. Caroline found  these wonderful pans during a recent trip to Valencia, Spain. Although it looks  a little similar in appearance to a wok, you do not stir paella while it is  cooking! The secret to the perfect paella is to cook it until it is almost  burned, forming a crunchy crust on the bottom, called soccarat.</p>
