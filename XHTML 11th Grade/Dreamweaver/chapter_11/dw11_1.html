<p>Our property is not   far from a wildlife preserve. While it is tempting to feed some of our neighbors   like Ralph, feeding wildlife creates an artificial   gathering area, which is bad for the animals and for you. We donâ€™t want to   increase the risk of disease or injury to animals or guests!  Enjoying nature while at the same time   being careful not to disturb nature is a delicate balance that we strive for at   The Striped Umbrella.</p>
