1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the div. The elements within this div have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

    <p class="headings">Cooking Classes are fun!</p>
    <p class="body_text">Chef Carolyne loves to offer a fun and relaxing cooking school each  month in her newly refurbished kitchen. She teaches an <strong>adult class</strong> on the fourth Saturday of each month from 6:00 to 8:00 pm.  Each class will learn to cook a complete dinner and then enjoy the meal at the  end of the class with a wonderful wine pairing. This is a great chance to get  together with friends for a fun evening.</p>
    <p><span class="body_text"><img src="assets/fish.jpg" alt="Butterfly trout" width="250" height="153" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" />Chef Caroline also teaches a <strong>children's class</strong> on the second Tuesday of each month from 4:00 to  5:30 pm. Our young chefs will learn to cook two dishes that will accompany a  full meal served at 5:30 pm. Kids aged 5â€“8 years accompanied by an adult are  welcome. We also host small birthday parties where we put the guests to work  baking and decorating the cake! Call for times and prices.</span></p>
    <p class="body_text"><img src="assets/children_cooking.jpg" alt="Two young chefs at work" width="200" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" />We offer several special adult classes throughout the year. The <strong>Valentine Chocolate Extravaganza</strong> is a particular  favorite. You will learn to dip strawberries, make truffles, and bake a sinful  Triple Chocolate Dare You Torte. We also host the <strong>Not So Traditional Thanksgiving</strong> class and the <strong>Super Bowl Snacks</strong> class each year with rave reviews. Watch the Web  site for details!</p>
    <p class="body_text">Prices are $45.00 for each adults' class and $15.00 for each   children's class. Sign up for classes by calling 555-963-8271 or by emailing us: <a href="mailto:carolyne@carolynescreations.com">Sign me up!</a></p>
