KAPALUA --- For centuries, the people of Kapalua have practiced the ancient Hawaiian philosophy of malama ka'aina, "caring for the land". Today, the Kapalua Resort continues to practice lokahi, harmony between man and nature, which is the guiding principle in the development of this pristine sanctuary of Kapalua and its surrounding community. The vast lands of Kapalua encompass two immense nature preserves - from the top of Pu'u Kukui Nature Preserve, the highest peak in the West Maui Mountains, to the edge of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Honolua Bay Marine Life Conservation District. The fact that this huge tract of land is one of Hawaii's few intact ahupua'a in the entire state makes Kapalua a special place to discover and reconnect with nature.
