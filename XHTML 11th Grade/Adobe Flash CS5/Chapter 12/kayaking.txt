One of my favorite outdoor activities is kayaking. There are several types of kayaking adventures including sea, recreational, and river kayaking. River kayaking can provide the most excitement and danger, while recreational kayaking (primarily on lakes) provides for a more relaxing outing. Sea kayaking has the advantage of getting you close to nature and sea life.
