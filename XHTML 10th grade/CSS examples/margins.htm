<h2>Midsummer Night's Dream: Act 1 Scene 1</h2>
<p>
Either to die or to abjure
For ever the society of men
</p>

<p>
Therefore fair <a href="hermia.htm">Hermia</a>, question your desires;
Know of your youth, examine well your blood
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice
You can endure the livery of a nun
For aye to be shady cloister mew'd
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon,
</p>

<p>Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
To undergo such maiden <a href="pilgrim.htm">Pilgrimage</a>;
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.
</p>
