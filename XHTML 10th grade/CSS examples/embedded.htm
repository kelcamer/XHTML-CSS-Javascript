<h1>Midsummer Night's Dream: Act 1 Scene 1</h1>

Either to die or to abjure<br />
For ever the society of men<br />
Therefore fair <a href="hermia.htm">Hermia</a>, question your desires;<br />
Know of your youth, examine well your blood<br />
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice<br />
You can endure the livery of a nun<br />
For aye to be shady cloister mew'd<br />
To live a barren sister all your life,<br />
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon,<br />
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,<br />
To undergo such maiden <a href="pilgrim.htm">Pilgrimage</a>;<br />
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,<br />
Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn<br />
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.<br />
