Brain researchers estimate that your 
unconscious database outweighs the conscious on an order exceeding
ten million to one. This database is the source of your hidden genius.
 In other words, a part of you is much smarted than you are. The wise 
people regularly consult that smarter part.

Crazy people who are productive are geniuses. Crazy people who are rich are eccentric. 
Crazy people who are neither productive nor rich are just plain crazy. Geniuses and people
are both out in the middle of a deep ocean, geniuses swim, crazy people drown. Most of us are sitting
safely on the shore. Take a chance and get your feet wet.
