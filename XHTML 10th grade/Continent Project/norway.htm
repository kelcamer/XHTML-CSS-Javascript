    The Norwegian Oil Industry has made Norway <span class="different">one of the wealthiest countries in the world.</span> The Norwegian Parliament has established a Government Pension Fund that at the end of 2011 is expected to reach an impressive 3.080 billion Norwegian Kroner, which is about <span class="emphasis">US $ 531 billions.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Anyway, during the last years of <span class="different">financial crisis,</span> these funds has helped Norway through the crises, so far at least, by making the Norwegian economy stabile.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

The portfolio of shares and other equities is expected to have a market value of NOK 4.190 billion at the beginning of 2015, and NOK 5.866 when we enter 2020.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Here's something that may surprise you. Did you know that each year in October the Tax Record for every adult Norwegian is published for anyone to read and see?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<span class="emphasis">That's right. In Norway, you can check out what our neighbors and friends earned last year; how much they paid in taxes and how wealthy they are.  This ensures that everyone pays their "fair" share, even though the king are exempt from paying ANY taxes WHATSOEVER.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<span class="different">Neighbors, colleagues, friends, politicians and ministers, all of them are in the public tax records, EXCEPT the King and the Royal family. Their wealth and income are not public.</span> </td>
