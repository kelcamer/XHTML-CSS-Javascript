		<td><h4>Owl City's music is described as indietronica and synthpop and is often described as belonging under the "electronic music" label.  Young has stated that he is inspired by disco and European electronic music, as well as instrumental genres such as drone, ambient, and post-rock. He cites his biggest influences as Johnathon Ford of Unwed Sailor and Thomas Newman. </h4></td>
		<td><h4>Young also incorporates a large amount of his Christian faith into his music, since he is a vocal Christian. Young's faith is evident on the new album, "All Things Bright and Beautiful", especially in "Galaxies". Explaining why the faith-filled song was added to the mix, he said, "I feel like if I were ever to hide the fact that that’s what’s so important to me, it would be a crime, that I should probably be put in jail for that."</h4></td>

<!--Lyrics to Fireflies-->
Leave my door open just a crack.<br />
(Please take me away from here.)<br />
Cause I feel like such an insomniac.<br />
(Please take me away from here.)<br /><br />

Why do I tire of counting sheep?<br />
(Please take me away from here.)<br />
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep<br /><br />

To ten million fireflies.<br />
I'm weird, cause I hate goodbyes<br />
I got misty eyes as they said farewell<br /><br />

But I'll know where several are<br />
If my dreams get real bizarre<br />
Cause I saved a few,<br />
And I keep them in a jar.<br /><br />

I'd like to make myself believe<br />
That planet Earth turns slowly.<br />
It's hard to say that I'd<br />
Rather stay awake when I'm asleep,<br />
Cause everything is never as it seems.<br />
(When I fall asleep.)<br /><br />

I'd like to make myself believe<br />
That planet Earth turns slowly.<br />
It's hard to say that I'd<br />
Rather stay awake when I'm asleep<br /></h3>
