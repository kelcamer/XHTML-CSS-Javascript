<H1>CSS1 and CSS2</H1>
<P>Cascading Style Sheets Level 1 (CCS1) was released in December 1996. Internet Explorer 5.5, Netscape 6,
 and Opera 5 offer good to excellent support for CSS1. Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 (CSS2) was released 
in May 1998. At the time of this writing, no browsers fully support CSS2, but some of the new properties 
are  variously supported by the browsers listed above. As always, you must test your work in multiple 
browsers to ensure the compatibility of your code.</P>
