<P>CSS is based on a syntax that is designed to be easy to write and read. With CSS, 
you write style rules that select an HTML element and declare style characteristics 
for the element. The World Wide Web Consortium <A HREF="http://www.w3.org">(http://www.w3.org)
</A> maintains the specifications that define CSS. Currently, there are two versions of CSS,
 Release 1 (CSS1) and Release 2 (CSS2).</P>
