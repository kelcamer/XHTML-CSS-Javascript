		<td>Peter the Great understood that Russia was outdated by almost 200 years.<br />  He realized that because the "times are a-changing", updated military equipment, education, and other technologies were necessary in maintaining and ruling a successful country.<br /> </td>
		<td>Peter's major military achievement was the city of St. Petersburg.  The purpose of creating this city, was because Russia needed a seaport for easy access to Western civilization in Europe.  Additionally, Peter the Great paid a European army to train his subjects in the new, advanced ways.  These practices boosted Russia's technology by 200 years.</td>
		<td>Peter used Westernization to unite Russia.  By definition, Westernization is assimilation of Western culture; the social process of becoming familiar with or converting to the customs and practices of Western civilization.  For example, Peter the Great ordered all people to shave off their beards.  Anyone who wished to have a beard remain must a beard tax, and hang a metal plate below their neck to show that they have paid it.  This ensured that there would be no cultural problems.  Everyone would learn how to be European.  Another way he westernized Russia is that he created a requirement that in order to marry, you must go through school, and learn math and science.  After you graduate, you must become a teacher for 4 years until you can earn a marriage license.  Laws like these greatly raised the general population's education level, resulting in an altogether more innovative country. </td>

		<td>The following picture shows his throne, which is an indication of the amount of wealth that he brought Russia in this tough time.</td>
		<td>This is another picture of St.Petersburg.  The fountains were so expensive to run, his servants would only turn it on when he walked by, and over 100 fountains would dance for him.</td>
		<td>Peter's technological advancements are evident in any picture of his palace, or his great city, St. Petersburg, as you can see below.</td>
