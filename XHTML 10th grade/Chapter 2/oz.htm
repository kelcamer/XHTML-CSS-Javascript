<H3>An excerpt from The Wizard of OZ</H3>

<H2>Chapter 1</H2>

<H1>The Cyclone</H1>
<P>From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also.</P>

<P>Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.</P>

<P>"There's a cyclone coming, Em," he called to his wife.  "I'll
go look after the stock."  Then he ran toward the sheds where the
cows and horses were kept.</P>

<P>Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door.  One glance
told her of the danger close at hand.</P>

<P>"Quick, Dorothy!" she screamed.  "Run for the cellar!"</P>
